# Sentiment Analysis Pipeline 🧠📊

A complete end-to-end sentiment analysis project that processes social media text data, extracts features, trains multiple machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and deploys the best-performing model in a production-ready pipeline.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a practical NLP pipeline for sentiment classification using a Twitter dataset. It covers the entire machine learning workflow from preprocessing to model deployment and includes visualizations and saved artifacts for reproducibility.

### 🔍 Goals:
- Preprocess and clean raw tweet data.
- Extract informative textual features using TF-IDF.
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models.
- Select and persist the best model based on F1-score.
- Save the full pipeline for deployment and future predictions.

## 🛠 Future Improvements

- Use transformer models like BERT for contextual understanding.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or Optuna.
- Implement explainability (e.g., SHAP or LIME).
- Deploy the pipeline via FastAPI or Flask for real-time predictions.
